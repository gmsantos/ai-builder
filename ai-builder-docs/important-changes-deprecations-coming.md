## Form processing and object detection preview models in AI Builder are deprecated

Effective March 5, 2020, any form processing and object detection models created using AI Builder before this date will be deprecated. Until June 8, 2020, these models will continue to function, and Microsoft will continue to provide support, however some functionality may be disabled. After June 8, 2020, these models will no longer work.

Beginning March 5, 2020, customers will need to recreate their existing form processing and object detection models with the new model versions. Any models created after this date will automatically use the new model versions and require no further action.

After March 5, 2020, customers are encouraged to transition to the new model versions as soon as possible.

* [Transition to use a new object detection model version](transition-new-object-detection-model.md)
